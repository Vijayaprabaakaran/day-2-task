Difference between document and window objects

=>A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.
=>When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object. The document object is the root node of the HTML document. The document object is a property of the window object.
=>BOM : The window object represents a window in browser. An object of window is created automatically by the browser.
=>DOM -> Document Object Model in JavaScript is the API to access the elements inside the document. It maps the entire Document into an hierarchy of parent and child tree.
=>The window object in JavaScript provides access to the browser's history, location, and other properties and methods that allow us to interact with the browser window itself. It contains information about the browser window, like the size, the document the window contains, and the windowâ€™s history.
=>The document object represents the structure of the web page as a whole and provides access to the content of the page, as well as methods for manipulating that content. It contains information about the content of the page, like the URL, the title, the content, and the links.
